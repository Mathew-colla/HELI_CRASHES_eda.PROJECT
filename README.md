# HELI_CRASHES_eda.PROJECT
The Heli_Crashes dataset records global helicopter accidents, including causes, locations, and casualties. This repository provides cleaned data, exploratory analysis, and visualizations to uncover patterns and insights, supporting aviation safety research and data-driven decision-making.
# HELI_CRASHES_EDA

## Project Overview

The project analyzes a global dataset of helicopter accidents, providing insights into crash patterns, contributing factors, and risk trends. This project focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to support aviation safety research, decision-making, and risk management.

## Dataset

The dataset includes detailed records of helicopter incidents, featuring:

-Crash date and location
-Aircraft model and operator type
-Causes of accidents
-Number of casualties

## Objectives

-Clean and preprocess raw data for analysis
-Perform exploratory data analysis to detect trends and patterns
-Visualize relationships using scatter plots, heatmaps, pairplots, and histograms
-Identify factors contributing to crashes
-Provide actionable insights for aviation safety improvements
